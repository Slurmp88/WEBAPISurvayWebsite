        <P>Over the course of my life I've gotten to go to a great deal of differnet places.
            Since I've been to so many places I figured listing them would make a decent collage
            for this assignment. Personally favorite place I've visited is still rome, really just
            Italy in general. The food is fantastic and its plentiful, the only place that was close
            was Spain. And Rome and the Vatican city is beautiful, again only rivaled by Spain.
            Overall if I were to recommend a trip I'd say Italy or Spain.
            </P>
